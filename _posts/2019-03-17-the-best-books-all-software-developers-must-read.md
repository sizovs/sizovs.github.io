Books are your best mentor. If you read one good programming book every month, roughly ten pages a day, you’ll soon have a firm grasp on the industry and distinguish yourself from nearly every developer around you.

There are thousands of books, but not all of them are equally good. Below is my list of the best programming books of all time. I will keep this list in sync with new releases.

This book is a fast-track to **design patterns** - battle-proven solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.

This book's biggest strength is that it includes tons of code examples, including some long and in-depth ones. Instead of just listing rules or principles of clean code, many of the chapters go through these code examples and iteratively improve them. This book is a must-read for every professional software developer.
