Conferences are a great place to network with like-minded professionals as well as learn about technologies and best practices. There are thousands of conferences happening around the world, but not all of them are equally good. Below is my ultimate list of the best vendor-independent engineering conferenes. **I personally attended every conference on the list**.

## JokerConf

**Audience**: Java developers ·  **Location:** Saint Petersburg, Russia · **Date**: 25–26 Oct 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/jugru)
This is one of the best conferences organized by Java User Group in Russia. The venue, the staff, the travel organization and of course the audience is excellent. The conference offers good soft and hard-core talk balance. The only issue is that *some* talks are in Russian. That might scare some international attendees.

<br>

## CraftConf

**Audience**: developers, managers ·  **Location:** Budapest, Hungary · **Date**: 7–10 May 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/craftconf)
CRAFT is the most well-organized general software development conference in Europe. The conference organizers excel at everything they do – from organization to the content. Here you will learn about tools, methods, and practices from the best speakers and practitioners in the software development community. This is a really good conference.

<br>

## GOTO Berlin

**Audience**: developers, managers ·  **Location:** Berlin, Germany · **Date**: 21–25 Oct 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/gotober)

GOTO is a general software development conference that covers wide range of topics from coding to management. The content is very diverse and thought-provoking. The conference allows you to meet new people easily and hang out at one of the expo booths, because there is plenty of breaks and room available between sessions. The conference also runs in Copenhagen and Amsterdam.

<br>

## Devoxx Belgium

**Audience**: Java developers ·  **Location:** Antwerp, Belgium · **Date**: 4–8 Nov 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/devoxx)

Devoxx is an annual community conference organized by the Belgian Java User Group. The conference has become the biggest Java conference in the world. Devoxx sets high standards for other Java conferences. I believe that every Java developer must attend Devoxx at least once (and try Belgian beer). The conference also runs in the London, Poland, Amsterdam and Chicago.

<br>

## The Lead Developer

**Audience**: developers, team leaders ·  **Location:** London, UK · **Date**: 11–12 Jun 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/theleaddev)

As a tech lead, you have to be a great developer. But you also need to be a good team leader, be commercially astute, and stay on top of all the tech developments and trends coming over the horizon. The Lead Developer conference prepares you for a tech leaders role and covers the wide range of topics that every lead developer need to know. Really good conference!

<br>

## GeekOut

**Audience**: Java developers ·  **Location:** Tallinn, Estonia · **Date**: 26–27 Sep 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/geekoutee)

GeekOut is a high-quality conference for Java developers in a cozy city of Tallinn. It's well-organized, has a great venue and speakers lineup. GeekOut gathers 600 participants every year and has a better cost/value ratio than other Java conferences in Northern Europe. GeekOut organizers are seasoned Java practitioners with good understanding of what Java developers need to know.

<br>

## QCon San Francisco

**Audience**: software architects ·  **Location:** San Francisco, US · **Date**: 4–8 Mar 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/qconsf)

QCon is a large conference for senior software engineers and architects on the patterns, practices, and use cases leveraged by the world’s most innovative software shops. The conference is well-organized, the talks are diverse, most of them are relevant and deeply technical. That I like about the conference is that you can attend hands-on workshops led by industry experts. The conference also runs in New York, San Francisco, London, Brazil, and Shanghai.

<br>

## JavaZone

**Audience**: Java developers ·  **Location:** Oslo, Norway · **Date**: 10 Sep 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/javazone)

JavaZone is organized by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group. Its goal is to organize a community-driven conference for Java developers where they can learn new things, share knowledge, and socialize. JavaZone is one of the most visited Java conferences in Europe. Every year, the conference gathers many Java champions and takes content quality seriously. The only downside is that the trip can blow your family budget, because Oslo is very expensive city.

## The Principal Developer

**Audience**: development leaders · **Location:** Riga, Latvia · **Date**: 23–24 May 2019

![Conference](/images/the_principal_logo.png)

If conferences are too theoretical for you and you prefer workshops, consider this 2-day masterclass for experienced engineers. The course takes your technical skills and put them on steroids. You will understand how organizations work, learn secrets of good development processes, improve communication, teamwork, and mentoring skills. The goal of this course is to make you the key asset in any modern technology organization. **The course is invite-only and has certain admission requirements.**

## JFokus

**Audience**: Java developers · **Location:** Stockholm, Sweden · **Date**: 4-6 Feb 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/jfokus)

JFokus is a general software development conference about literally everything – Web, DevOps, IoT, AI, Cloud, Big Data, Future and Trends. Even so, I see a major focus on Java, Kotlin, Scala and other JVM languages (hence "J" the name). It's a large and well-organized conference with some famous speakers on stage. I attended the conference in 2016 together with my team and we liked it.

<br>

## Build Stuff

**Audience**: Developers · **Location:** Vilnius, Lithuania · **Date**: 13–15 Nov 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/buildstufflt)

Build Stuff Lithuania is one of the largest software development events in Baltics. The conference is well-organized, has many good speakers and diversity of talks. What makes this conference particularly great is that it's not just another money-making conference. It's organized with passion and special care about attendees and speakers.

<br>

## SoCraTes

**Audience**: Developers · **Location:** Soltau, Germany · **Date**: 22–25 Aug 2019

SoCraTes is about software craftsmanship, sustainable creation of useful software in a responsible way. The event is run as a non-profit, low-cost event and has a lot of highly collaborative interactions and Open Space sessions. You should attend this event if you want are ready to interact with other attendees, not just sit and listen.

<br>

## Øredev

**Audience**: developers, architects ·  **Location:** Malmö, Sweden · **Date**: 6–8 Nov 2019

The conference gathers 1300 participants to talk about Web, Data Science, Cloud, .Net, AR/VR, IoT, Agile, Android, Machine Learning, Architecture, AI, Quality, Security, DevOps, Java, JavaScript, Tools, and much more. Diversity of talks is making Øredev one of the most interesting conference to attend. Only at Øredev you will hear about cognitive aspects of software design and morality.

<br>

## NDC London

**Audience**: developers, architects ·  **Location:** London, UK · **Date**: 27-31 Jan 2020

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/ndc_conferences)

NDC is one of the world's largest independent software conferences covering pretty much everything you need to know about software development. NDC speakers come from all over the world and are recognized as experts and thought leaders in their field. What I like about NDC is that it offers many full-day workshops. The conference also runs in Copenhagen, Oslo, Sydney and Minnesota.
