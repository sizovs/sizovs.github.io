## JokerConf

**Location:** Saint Petersburg, Russia
**Date:** 25–26 Oct 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/jugru)
This is one of the best conferences organized by Java User Group in Russia. The venue, the staff, the travel organization and of course the audience is excellent. The conference offers good soft and hard-core talk balance. **The only issue is that some talks are in Russian and you will probably need a visa.** That might scare some international attendees.

## CraftConf

**Date:** 7–10 May 2019

CRAFT is a very well-organized general software development conference in Europe. The conference organizers excel at everything they do – from organization to the content. Here you will learn about tools, methods, and practices from the best speakers and practitioners in the software development community. This is a really good conference.

**Date:** 21–25 Oct 2019

GOTO is a general software development conference that covers wide range of topics from coding to management. The content is very diverse and thought-provoking. The conference allows you to meet new people easily and hang out at one of the expo booths, because there is plenty of breaks and room available between sessions. The conference also runs in Copenhagen and Amsterdam.

Devoxx is an annual community conference organized by the Belgian Java User Group. Devoxx has become one of the best Java conference in the world. Devoxx sets high standards for other Java conferences. I believe that every Java developer must attend Devoxx at least once (and try Belgian beer). The conference also runs in the London, Poland, Amsterdam and Chicago.

## The Lead Developer

**Location:** London, UK
**Date:** 11–12 Jun 2019

As a tech lead, you have to be a great developer. But you also need to be a good team leader, be commercially astute, and stay on top of all the tech developments and trends coming over the horizon. The Lead Developer conference prepares you for a tech leaders role and covers the wide range of topics that every lead developer need to know. Really good conference!

QCon is a large conference for senior software engineers and architects on the patterns, practices, and use cases leveraged by the world’s most innovative software shops. The conference is well-organized, the talks are diverse, most of them are relevant and deeply technical.

## JavaZone

**Location:** Oslo, Norway
**Date:** 10 Sep 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/javazone)
JavaZone is organized by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group. Its goal is to organize a community-driven conference for Java developers where they can learn new things, share knowledge, and socialize. JavaZone is one of the most visited Java conferences in Europe. Every year, the conference gathers many Java champions and takes content quality seriously. The only downside is that the trip can blow your family budget, because Oslo is very expensive city.

## JFokus

**Location:** Stockholm, Sweden
**Date:** 4-6 Feb 2019

![Unconference](https://avatars.io/twitter/jfokus)
JFokus is a general software development conference about literally everything – Web, DevOps, IoT, AI, Cloud, Big Data, Future and Trends. Even so, I see a major focus on Java, Kotlin, Scala and other JVM languages (hence "J" the name). It's a large and well-organized conference with some famous speakers on stage. I attended the conference in 2016 together with my team and we liked it.
