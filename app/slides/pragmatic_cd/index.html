## What?
### A methodology for reducing the **cost**, **time** and **risk** of delivering incremental changes to users.
## Qualities
### 1. Software is always in shippable state once code is pushed into the mainline (including infrastructure, configuration, data)
### 2. Push-button deployment for any desired version
]
???
**What**
- cost (optimize, automate)
- time (eliminate bottlenecks and waste, reducing wip)
- risk (small increments, reliability (no manual steps, consisteny), rollbacks, resiliance, mmtd, mmtr)
-
1. No need to wait for off-peak hours; non-ready features are deployed too;
2. Including old versions, rollbacks

# Anatomy of Deployment Pipeline

---
background-image: url(pipeline_classic.png)
???
Fail-fast

---
background-image: url(pipeline_classic.png)
## All changes to production go through deployment pipeline
???
Easy to ensure - you just restrict deployment from local machines.
### Every change triggers the feedback process

---
background-image: url(pipeline_classic.png)
## All changes to production go through version control (from mainline!)
???
- No release branches! No "quick fixes"!
- RB evil - Bug fixing: you fix it twice. In different codebases. Do you write tests twice too?
- No releases from feature branches.

---
background-image: url(pipeline_classic.png)
## Build only once
???
- Every build is potential release (vs. SNAPSHOT, BETA etc.)
- means that your application is environment agnostic. No switches, Profiles etc.

---
background-image: url(pipeline_classic.png)
## Test on production-like environment
???
Or test on production!

---
background-image: url(pipeline_classic.png)
## Deploy the same way to every environment

And the same version! :-) "LATEST" in the middle of pipeline

# Commit Stage

---
# Continuous Integration compliance checklist
### 1. All developers push the code at least once a day (to Mainline)
### 2. All developers run tests locally before pushing the code (and never push the code if tests fail)
### 3. **Every change** results in a build and tests run
### 4. Developers never push the code if a build is broken (why the build is broken if #3 is true?)
### 5. Build is **always** fixed within ten minutes of it going red
???
- 2. not daily, every H. but every build!
- 5. ABR - always be ready

---
class: center, middle, bad
# I will work in a branch and sync with Mainline every day.
## (and push when my feature is ready)
???

# I will use Mainline as a primary tool for identifying regression in my code

---
# CI changes dynamics of a game
### - No painful merges (try aggressive refactoring w/o CI)
### - Small increments (easier code review, more opportunities for pairing)
### - Evergreen Mainline requires engineering rigor (TDD, preflight quality control)
### - Feature branching becomes unnecessary (brings back synchronous code reviews)
### - Faster feedback from Sheriff on Duty (SoD)
### - Faster feedback from downstream quality gates (if any)
???
- Not only SoD, but all workstreams can see and use your code - awesome!
- One goal, extra care. If someone can release "in a special way", he doesn't care.

## One thing that I really like about open-source is that it really allows different people to work together. We don't have to like each other. And sometimes we really don't like each other.

# Anti-pattern: Feature Toggles introduce additional failure mode

---
class: center, middle
> ### Release toggles are a useful technique and lots of teams use them. However they should be your last choice when you're dealing with putting features into production. Your first choice should be to break the feature down so you can safely introduce parts of the feature into the product. The advantages of doing this are the same ones as any strategy based on small, frequent releases. You reduce the risk of things going wrong and you get valuable feedback on how users actually use the feature that will improve the enhancements you make later.
### (c) Martin Fowler at [Bliki](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html)
???
- Try breaking the feature down and try to make increments visible to customer asap to get feedback from the real world and adapt.
- Keeping a fat feature under toggle can lead to big bank release. Avoid this.
